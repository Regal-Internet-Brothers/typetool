typetool
========

**This module enables users to use non-standard type-names for the sake of future potential memory optimization.**

**ATTENTION: Any modules written with this module's "extensions" will work as they normally would to normal Monkey users. Basically, if you see something with a type like 'Long', treat it as an 'Int' (The same goes for 'Double', or even 'Half' if that becomes a thing; treat those the same as the 'Float' type). Any changes made to my module will be compatible with the official releases of Monkey unless otherwise specified. The only difference is future-proofing. This is mainly done for my own projects, and should not concern users of my modules at this time. In the event I publicly release a version of Monkey with these extensions properly implemented, the modules built with these extensions will be supported by the language itself. If you wish to future-proof/optimize your own modules using this module, please read all of the notes before making a final decision.**
